# Project Plan

## Title
Analyzing the temperature change and crop yield dynamics in Ireland from 2009 to 2023.

## Main Question
How is temperature change impacting the crop yield over the years and if there is any pattern that can realized by visualization?

## Description

The project aims to explore and understand the relationship between temperature change and crop yield in Ireland. Understanding this relationship is crucial for following reasons:

1. Selecting the appropriate crops can help to improve the overall yield.
2. Increases awareness on temperature impact on crops.


## Datasources

### Datasource1: Temperature change countrywise
* Metadata: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET/metadata
* Dataset: https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Environment_Temperature_change_E_Europe.zip
* Data Type: CSV

The CSV file contains temperature change data for Ireland from 1961 to 2023

### Datasource2: Crop Yield (2008 - 2023) - Ireland 
* Metadata: https://data.gov.ie/dataset/aqa04-crop-yield-and-production/resource/ca2113ee-d9f3-4654-acc6-777213ae9330
* Data URL: https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/AQA04/CSV/1.0/en
* Data Type: CSV

The CSV file contains data of crop yield in Ireland.



## Work Packages

1. **Problem Statement and Data Collection** [#1][i1]
   - Define the problem statement and research objectives.
   - Gather Temperature and AQI data sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning** [#2][i2]
   - Merge and integrate the temperature and AQI datasets, aligning them on common timestamps.
   - Perform data cleaning operations, such as handling missing values.

3. **Data Analysis** [#3][i3]
   - Explore the relationship between temperature and AQI through visualizations.

4. **Testing and Report** [#4][i4]
    - Record the findings and insights from the analysis in the report.
