# Project Plan

## Title
Analyzing of Temperature and Air Quality Dynamics in Bangalore

## Main Question

1. What are the trends in temperature and AQI over time?
2. What are the daily and weekly patterns in temperature and AQI?
3. Is there a correlation between temperature and AQI levels?
4. Are there any significant anomalies in temperature and AQI data?

## Description

The project aims to explore and understand the relationship between temperature and Air Quality Index (AQI) in Bangalore. Understanding this relationship is crucial for following reasons:

1. Climate (temperature) and air quality are two critical factors that influence the health and living of urban populations. 
2. Bangalore, known as the Silicon Valley of India, is a rapidly growing metropolitan area that faces unique environmental challenges. 
3. As the city expands and industrializes, it experiences notable variations in temperature and air quality, both of which have a huge impacts on public health, urban planning, and environmental sustainability.
